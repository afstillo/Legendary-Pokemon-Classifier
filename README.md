# Legendary-Pokemon-Classifier
A Legendary Pokemon classifier using machine learning techniques developed as a final project for CSIT-456 - Advanced Techniques in Data Science.

Includes data cleaning and preparation of the existing data set, as well as usage and evaluation of the Logistic Regession and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) machine learning models for classification.

Dataset obtained from [The Complete Pokemon Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/pokemon) on kaggle.
